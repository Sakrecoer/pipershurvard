This is Forty, my latest and greatest addition to HTML5 UP and, per its incredibly
creative name, my 40th (woohoo)! It's built around a grid of "image tiles" that are
set up to smoothly transition to secondary landing pages (for which a separate page
template is provided), and includes a number of neat effects (check out the menu!),
extra features, and all the usual stuff you'd expect. Hope you dig it!
